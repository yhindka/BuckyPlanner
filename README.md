# BuckyPlanner
X5 Team Project Proposal
Title: Bucky's Planner
Description: This program crafts a To-Do List that allows students to create and prioritize tasks. It is designed
to replace the planner created by the University of Wisconsin for students, as that planner is largely unused and 
is not useful. In addition, an electronic planner will help decrease the University's reliance on paper, contributing
to a enviroment-friendly campus.
